    your_own_analysis.jl

    This is a template for you to create your own analytic function.
    Everything here is commented out, so no code here has any effect.
    You need to uncomment and complete the code to make it work.
    You also need to register your own functionality in "AmpModel.jl":
    see the lines that contain `YourOwnAnalysis`.

# function act(
#     ::Type{Val{your_own_analysis}},
#     req ::Associative;
#     # whatever keyword arguments you want to add
#     )
#     ## put your own code here
# end
