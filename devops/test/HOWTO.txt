Test Experiments
================

1) Continuous upgrade:
To test reailablity of the upgrade procedure for any new upgrade image.
Experiment setup: copy autorun.sh to the root of the factory settings sdcard. And initiate an upgrade by calling /sdcard/upgrade/scripts/perform_upgrade.sh. The script should conduct 50 upgrades continously with 10 minutes in between.

Optionally, each experiment reports 3 events to the experiment database:
- Cycle done, and device booted with the newly upgraded image.
- About to start another cycle: ideally after 10 minutes of the first event.
- A new upgrade issued.

To receive those events a web application should be published as follows:
database: to be created by importing experiment.sql. New database server information should be updated in database.php.inc.
wepapp: copy report_exp.php and database.php.inc to the web shared folder. Typically apache with mysql database support. beaglebone.info should be updated with the new URL to the updated web server inside autorun.sh.
Currently the webapp and database are temprary hosted at:
